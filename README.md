# CapTech_Elevate_Internship_Final_Website
The following video represents a live demo of the final product of the 2024 CapTech Elevate internship.

The project was for a hypothetical airline client called 'CapAir' who needed to modernize their booking and membership processes through a new, sleek website. My team built this site from scratch using React and Spring Boot. The team consisted of 11 members, and I worked with 2 others on the front end of the website. 

My primary contributions were:
- Direct collaboration with UX designer on Figma wireframes
- Fully designed and developed User Profile page
- Fully designed and developed Membership page
- Worked with another developer on the booking a flight user flow
- Integrated AWS cognito to handle user authentication on the site
- Wrote over 80 test cases for user authentication and other pages
