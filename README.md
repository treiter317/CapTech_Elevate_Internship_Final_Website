# CapTech_Elevate_Internship_Final_Website
The following video represents a live demo of the final product of the 2024 CapTech Elevate internship.

The project was for a hypothetical airline client called 'CapAir' who needed to modernize their booking and membership processes through a new, sleek website. My team built this site from scratch using React and Spring Boot. The team consisted of 11 members, and I worked with 2 others on the front end of the website. I also aided the UX designer with Figma wireframes to ensure clear and well thought out designs.
